Summary of the Fisher's Iris data set

The iris is a genus of plants with around 260-300 different species with either yellow, blue or multi-colored petals, which is why this plant was named after the Greek goddess of the rainbow (iris). [1] Why this plant is described here is as follows:

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher was a British statistician and geneticist who published “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems” in the journal “Annals of Eugenics” in 1936. In his work, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function for distinguishing iris species based on the morphology of their flowers, using the Fisher’s Iris dataset. This dataset is also called Anderson’s Iris dataset because Edgar Anderson’s collected the data in Canada to quantify the morphological variation of iris flowers of three related species. [2,3]

The dataset contains values of 50 flowers of the three flower species “Iris setosa” (bristle-sword lily), “Iris versicolor” (different-coloured sword-lily) and “Iris virginica” (Virginian sword-lily). For each flower, the following information was collected:
    the length of the sepal leaf in cm (sepalLength);
    the width of the sepal leaf in cm (“sepalWidth”);
    the length of the petal in cm (“petalLength”);
    the width of the petal in cm (“petalwidth”); 
    the species of flower ("class"). [2]
