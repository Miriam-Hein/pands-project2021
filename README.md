## Summary of the Fisher's Iris data set

The *iris* is a genus of plants with around 260-300 different species with either yellow, blue or multi-colored petals, which is why this plant was named after the Greek goddess of the rainbow (iris). [1]

Why this plant is described here is as follows:

Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher was a British statistician and geneticist who published *“The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”* in the journal *“Annals of Eugenics”* in 1936. In his work, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function for distinguishing iris species based on the morphology of their flowers, using the *Fisher’s Iris dataset*. This dataset is also called *Anderson’s Iris dataset* because Edgar Anderson’s collected the data mainly in Canada to quantify the morphological variation of iris flowers of three related species. [2,3]

The dataset contains values of 50 flowers of the three flower species *“Iris setosa”*, *“Iris versicolor”* and *“Iris virginica”*. For each flower, the following information was collected:
   - the length of the sepal leaf in cm ("sepalLength");
   - the width of the sepal leaf in cm (“sepalWidth”);
   - the length of the petal in cm (“petalLength”);
   - the width of the petal in cm (“petalwidth”); 
   - the species of flower ("class"). [2]
